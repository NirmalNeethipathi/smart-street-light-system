Smart-street-light-system

ABSTRACT
Smart Street light is an automated system which automates the street. The main aim of Smart Street light is to reduce the power consumption when there are no vehicle movements on the road. The Smart street light will glow with high intensity when there are vehicles on the road otherwise the lights will remain dim. With advancement of technology, things are becoming simpler and easier for everyone in the world today. Automation is the use of control systems and information technologies to reduce the need for human work in the production of goods and services. In the scope of industrialization, automation is a step beyond mechanization, whereas mechanization provided human operators with machinery to assist the users with the muscular requirements of work, automation greatly decreases the need for human sensory and mental requirements as well. Automation plays an increasingly important role in the world economy and in daily experience. Automatic systems are being preferred over manual system. The research work shows automatic control of streetlights as a result of which power is saved to an extent. The Smart street light provides a solution for energy saving which is achieved by sensing an approaching vehicle using the IR sensors and then switching ON a block of street lights ahead of the vehicle with high intensity. As the vehicle passes by, the trailing lights turn dim automatically. Thus, we save a lot of energy. So when there are no vehicles on the highway, then all the lights will remain dim.

**Smart Street Lighting** 
Street lights are doing more than ever in today’s smart cities. With digital networks and embedded sensors, they collect and transmit information that help cities monitor and respond to any circumstance, from traffic and air quality to crowds and noise. They can detect traffic congestion and track available parking spaces. Those very same networks can remotely control LED lights to turn on and off, flash, dim and more, offering cities a chance to maximize low-energy lighting benefits while also improving pedestrian and bicyclist safety. With street lights creating a network canopy, those networks of data can be used by more than just lighting departments, empowering even schools and businesses via a lighting infrastructure that brightens the future of the digital city. 

Smart lighting helps cities save energy, lower costs, reduce maintenance—all while better serving citizens and reducing energy use and CO2 emissions. Automation and networked 
control 	can 	further 	increase 	your 	energy 	savings 	and 	reduce 	maintenance 
spending. Networked street lighting built on a scalable platform can reduce crime up to 10% and make roadways safer through improved visibility. Leveraging intelligent control 
systems can rapidly increase lighting efficiencies and traffic management. 


**Arduino Uno R3** 
                 It is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328. Arduino is an open-source, prototyping platform and its simplicity makes it ideal for hobbyists or novice to use as well as professionals. The Arduino Uno has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with AC-toDC adapter or battery to get started. 
The Arduino Uno R3 uses an ATmega16U2 instead of the 8U2 found on the Uno (or the FTDI found on previous generations). This allows for faster transfer rates and more memory. No drivers needed for Linux or Mac (in file for Windows is needed and included in the Arduino IDE), and the ability to have the Uno show up as a keyboard, mouse, joystick, etc. The Arduino Uno differs from all preceding boards in that it does not use the FTDI USB-to-serial driver chip. Instead, it features the Atmega8U2 microcontroller chip programmed as a USB-to-serial converter. 
        The Uno R3 also adds SDA and SCL pins next to the AREF. In addition, there are two new pins placed near the RESET pin. One is the IOREF that allow the shields to adapt to the voltage provided from the board. The other is a not connected and is reserved for future purposes. The Uno R3 works with all existing shields but can adapt to new shields which use these additional pins. 
"Uno" means one in Italian and is named to mark the upcoming release of Arduino 1.0. Preferred quality and originals are made in Italy. The Arduino Uno and version 1.0 will be the reference versions of Arduino, moving forward. The Uno is the latest in a series of USB 
Arduino boards, and the reference model for the Arduino platform.
